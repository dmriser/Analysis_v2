(1) Add recAndGen check to MCLoader.cxx, this will require modifying the
    BaseDISHistogram class or finding some way to verify that the reconstructed
    and generated event are in the same bin.

(2) Add momentum corrections to the DataLoader.

(3) Check why h22Reader::get_particle(int monteCarloPID) is throwing partice
    not found warnings.

(4) Create a main that wires together an h22Options object with the other
    histogram filling classes and selection objects.  The main code which will
    do the histogram fills.  It will most likely have to be flagged like,
    ./fillDISHistograms -N=1000 -TYPE=MCRAD /path/to/files/*

(5) Think about where the Faraday charge load belongs, if not in the loading
    then one needs to be sure about what files were used in the load before
    going on to calculate the normalization.

(6) Start doing the logic for the cross section calculation code:
    (a) Loading 2D histograms
    (b) Slicing them into vectors of 1-D histograms
    (c) Operating on these vectors (division, scaling)

(7) Creating a drawing script to display final results.
