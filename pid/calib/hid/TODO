I fit fairly successfully the curves with 
a double gaussian.  The best fits provide 
estimates of eff, cont, and the difference. 

I then draw the cut boundary based on the 
maximum of the difference function. 

The last thing to do is make a linear cut 
boundary by fitting this from p~1.0->1.5. 

This is the last step and the justification 
for this is the contamination study.
