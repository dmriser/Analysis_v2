#	ToDo File for Analysis_v2 
# ------------------------------------------

  -> Decide on a standard set of coding 
     best practices and apply it throughout 
     the codebase

  -> Keep sure that libraries are flexible
     enough to process clas12 data if it 
     becomes root ready

  -> Fix event in h22Reader to be pointer 
     to event, so that it doesnt call the 
     copy constructor 10000000000000 times.

  -> Figure out a nice way to correct events 
     the new h22ElectronEvent class needs to be 
     corrected nicely 

# ------------------------------------------
#     Feature Request
# ------------------------------------------

(1) xml, json or other format configuration files 
    that participate with the OptionsParser
 
(2) multi-threaded analysis code 
    --> need concurrent containers 
    --> need chunk based or other way to 
    	read TTree 

(3) store parameters in a real database 
    not just a textfile based parameter 
    class (low prio)

[DataEventCut]
	-> It would be nice to not have to make 6 instances for each 
	   sector.  Also would be nice to avoid the if( cut.applies() && cut.is_enabled())
	   calls. 

	-> There is a big problem for any cut that needs the electron index, ie: hadron cuts
	   or corrected things.  There is no way to pass the extra index in.  It could be added
	   to the event object.  Maybe there is a better solution.
