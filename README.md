# analysis-main 

This c++ library is used to perform analysis of CLAS (E1-F) data, and depends on the CERN ROOT libraries.  It is still under active development, and although all are welcome to use it, it was not designed with other users in mind.  

## Installation 
This set of classes was checked with **ROOT 5.34.36** and compiled with **g++ 5.3.0** (c++11).  This project uses the build system SConstruct, install that before trying cloning the repo.

- Install root and SConstruct 
- Clone the repository 
- In the top directory, run the install script with `source install.csh` (default shell on ifarm).
